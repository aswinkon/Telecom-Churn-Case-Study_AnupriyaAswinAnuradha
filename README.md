Telecom Customer Churn Prediction Project
Overview: This project aims to predict customer churn within a leading telecom firm operating in the Indian and Southeast Asian markets. The objective is to build predictive models that identify high-risk churn customers and recognize the significant indicators influencing churn within the prepaid model, which is predominant in these regions.
Business Problem: In the highly competitive telecom industry, the average annual churn rate ranges from 15-25%. Retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, making churn prediction and reduction paramount for the business's sustainability.
Churn Definition: Churn, specifically for prepaid customers, is complex due to the lack of direct notice when customers switch providers. For this project, we've defined churn based on a usage-based model, where customers with zero usage (calls, internet, etc.) over a specified period are considered potential churners. Identifying and reducing churn among the top 20% of customers, responsible for around 80% of revenue, is the primary focus. High-value customers will be defined based on specific metrics (as detailed later) for targeted churn prediction.
Methodology: Customer-level data will be analyzed to understand patterns and behaviors indicating potential churn. 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will uncover correlations and features crucial for predictive modeling.
Modeling Predictive models, including machine learning algorithms, will be employed to forecast churn among high-value customers. These models will consider usage patterns, customer demographics, and other relevant features.
Evaluation: Models are evaluated based on their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, among other metrics. The goal is to build robust models that effectively identify potential churners.
